## Merging Guidelines

### Changes affecting ingestion-edge

Code updates are always safe to merge since production code updates are always
deployed manually.

### Changes affecting ingestion-sink

Code updates are always safe to merge since production code updates are always
deployed manually. See [these instructions](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SRE/pages/27921000/Ingestion+Sink#IngestionSink-Toupdatethecodeversion)
for updating the code version.

### Changes affecting ingestion-beam (including ingestion-core)

- Only merge changes to `main` that you want to propagate to production automatically
- Check [pipeline latency](https://yardstick.mozilla.org/d/bZHv1mUMk/pipeline-latency?orgId=1&from=now-6h&to=now) before merging, particularly if:
  - The merge will occur within 2 hours of the UTC date change, or
  - You are merging multiple PRs in quick suggestion

See the full [code deployment policy](https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SRE/pages/27922303/Ingestion+Beam#Prod-Code-Deployment-Policy)
for details.
