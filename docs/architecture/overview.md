# GCP Ingestion Architecture

This document specifies the architecture for GCP Ingestion as a whole.

## Architecture Diagram

![diagram.mmd](diagram.svg "Architecture Diagram")

- The Kubernetes `Ingestion Edge` sends messages from `Producers` (e.g.
  Firefox) to PubSub `Raw Topics`
- The `Raw Sink` job copies messages from PubSub `Raw Topics` to
  `BigQuery`
- The Dataflow `Decoder` job decodes messages from PubSub `Raw Topics` to
  PubSub `Decoded Topics`
    - The Dataflow `Decoder` job checks for existence of `document_id`s in
     `Cloud Memorystore` in order to deduplicate messages
- The Dataflow `Republisher` job reads messages from PubSub `Decoded Topics`,
  marks them as seen in `Cloud Memorystore` and republishes them to various
  lower volume derived topics including `Monitoring Sample Topics` and
  `Per DocType Topics`
- The Dataflow `Live Sink` job copies messages from PubSub `Decoded Topics`
  to `BigQuery`
- The `Decoded Sink` job copies messages from PubSub `Decoded Topics`
  to `BigQuery`

## Architecture Components

### Ingestion Edge

- Must send messages from producers to PubSub topics
- Must store messages on disk when PubSub is unavailable
   - Must attempt to deliver all new messages to PubSub before storing on disk
   - Must not be scaled down when there are messages on disk
- Must respond server error if PubSub and disk are both unavailable
    - Must use a 5XX error error code
- Must accept configuration mapping `uri` to PubSub Topic
    - Expected initial topics are Structured Ingestion, Telemetry, and Pioneer
- Must accept configuration defining HTTP headers to capture

### Raw Sink

- Must copy messages from PubSub topics to BigQuery
    - This copy may be for backfill, recovery, or testing
- Must not ack messages read from PubSub until they are delivered
- Must accept configuration mapping PubSub topics to BigQuery tables
- Should retry transient Cloud Storage errors indefinitely
    - Should use exponential back-off to determine retry timing

### Decoder

- Must decode messages from PubSub topics to PubSub topics
- Must not ack messages read from PubSub until they are delivered
- Must apply the following transforms in order
  ([implementations here](../../ingestion-beam/src/main/java/com/mozilla/telemetry/decoder/)):
    1. Parse `x_pipeline_proxy` attribute; if present with a valid value in
    [the edge submission timestamp format](https://github.com/mozilla/gcp-ingestion/blob/master/docs/edge.md#submission-timestamp-format),
    archive the value of `submission_timestamp` to `proxy_timestamp` and
    replace with the `x_pipeline_proxy` value
    1. Resolve GeoIP from `remote_addr` or `x_forwarded_for` attribute into
    `geo_*` attributes
    1. Parse `uri` attribute into multiple attributes
    1. Gzip decompress `payload` if gzip compressed
    1. Validate `payload` using a JSON Schema determined by attributes
    1. Parse `agent` attribute into `user_agent_*` attributes
    1. Produce `normalized_` variants of select attributes
    1. Inject `normalized_` attributes at the top level and other select
    attributes into a nested `metadata` top level key in `payload`
- Should deduplicate messages based on the `document_id` attribute using
  `Cloud MemoryStore`
    - Must ensure at least once delivery, so deduplication is only "best effort"
    - Should delay deduplication to the latest possible stage of the pipeline
    to minimize the time window between an ID being marked as seen in
    `Republisher` and it being checked in `Decoder`
- Must send messages rejected by transforms to a configurable error destination
    - Must allow error destination in BigQuery

### Republisher

- Must copy messages from PubSub topics to PubSub topics
- Must attempt to publish the `document_id` of each consumed message to
  `Cloud MemoryStore`
    - ID publishing should be "best effort" but must not prevent the message
    proceeding to further steps in case of errors reaching `Cloud MemoryStore`
- Must ack messages read from PubSub after they are delivered to all
  matching destinations
- Must not ack messages read from PubSub before they are delivered to all
  matching destinations
- Must accept configuration enabling republishing of messages to a debug
  topic if they contain an `x_debug_id` attribute
    - Must accept a compile-time parameter enabling or disabling debug republishing
    - Must accept a runtime parameter defining the destination topic
- Must accept configuration enabling republishing of a random sample of the
  input stream
    - Must accept a compile-time parameter setting the sample ratio
    - Must accept a runtime parameter defining the destination topic
- Must accept configuration mapping `document_type`s to PubSub topics
    - Must accept a compile-time parameter defining a topic pattern string
    (may be promoted to runtime if Dataflow adds support for PubSub topic
    names defined via `NestedValueProvider`)
    - Must accept a compile-time parameter defining which `document_type`s
    to republish
    - Must only deliver messages with configured destinations
- Must accept configuration mapping `document_namespace`s to PubSub topics
    - Must accept a compile-time parameter defining a map from document
    namespaces to topics
    - Must only deliver messages with configured destinations
- Must accept optional configuration for sampling telemetry data
    - Must accept a compile-time parameter defining a topic pattern string
    (may be promoted to runtime if Dataflow adds support for PubSub topic
    names defined via `NestedValueProvider`)
    - Must accept compile-time parameters defining the sampling ratio for
    each channel (nightly, beta, and release)


### Live Sink

- Must copy messages from PubSub topics to BigQuery
- Must not ack messages read from PubSub until they are delivered
- Must accept configuration mapping PubSub topics to BigQuery tables
- Must accept configuration for using streaming or batch loads
- Must transform all field names to lowercase with underscores (`snake_case`)
  and perform other field name cleaning to match the transformations
  expected by the [`jsonschema-transpiler`](https://github.com/mozilla/jsonschema-transpiler)
- Must set [`ignoreUnknownValues`](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.7.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/BigQueryIO.Write.html#ignoreUnknownValues--)
  to `true`
- Should retry transient BigQuery errors indefinitely
    - Should use exponential back-off to determine retry timing
- Must send messages rejected by BigQuery to a configurable error destination
    - Must allow error destinations in BigQuery

### Decoded Sink

- Must copy messages from PubSub topics to BigQuery
    - May be used to backfill BigQuery columns previously unspecified in the
     table schema
    - May be used by BigQuery, Spark, and Dataflow to access columns missing
     from BigQuery Tables
- Must not ack messages read from PubSub until they are delivered
- Must accept configuration mapping PubSub topics to BigQuery tables
- Should retry transient BigQuery errors indefinitely
    - Should use exponential back-off to determine retry timing

### Notes

PubSub stores unacknowledged messages for 7 days. Any PubSub subscription more
than 7 days behind requires a backfill.

Dataflow will extend ack deadlines indefinitely when consuming messages, and
will not ack messages until they are processed by an output or `GroupByKey`
transform.

Dataflow jobs achieve at least once delivery by *not* using GroupByKey
transforms and *not* falling more than 7 days behind in processing.

## Design Decisions

### Kubernetes Engine and PubSub

Kubernetes Engine is a scalable, managed service based on an industry standard.
PubSub is a simple, scalable, managed service. By comparison a compute instance
group instead of Kubernetes Engine and Kafka instead of PubSub would require
more operational overhead and engineering effort for maintenance.

### Different topics for "raw" and "validated" data

We don't want to have to repeat the validation logic in the case where we have
multiple consumers of the data. Raw data can be sent to a single topic to
simplify the edge service and then validated data can be sent to topics split
by `docType` and other attributes, in order to allow consumers for specific
sets of data.

### BigQuery

BigQuery provides a simple, scalable, managed service for executing SQL queries
over arbitrarily large or small amounts of data, with built-in schema
validation, hyperloglog functions, UDF support, and destination tables
(sometimes called materialized views) for minimizing cost and latency of
derived tables. Alternatives (such as Presto) would have more operational
overhead and engineering effort for maintenance, while generally being less
featureful.

### Archive messages from each stage of the pipeline as JSON payloads in BigQuery

One of the primary challenges of building a real-world data pipeline is
anticipating and adapting to changes in the schemas of messages flowing through
the system. Strong schemas and structured data give us many usability and
performance benefits, but changes to the schema at one point in the pipeline
can lead to processing errors or dropped data further down the pipeline.

Saving JSON messages as compressed bytes fields in BigQuery tables allows
use to gracefully handle new fields added upstream without needing to specify
those fields completely before they are stored. New columns can be added to a
table's schema and then restored via a backfill operation.

### Use destination tables

For complex queries that are calculated over time-based windows of data, using
destination tables allows us to save time and cost by only querying each new
window of data once.

### Use views for user-facing data

Views we create in BigQuery can be a stable interface for users while we
potentially change versions or implementations of a pipeline behind the scenes.
If we wanted to rewrite a materialized view, for example, we might run the new
and old definitions in parallel, writing to separate tables; when we’re
comfortable that the new implementation is stable, we could cut users over to
the new implementation by simply changing the definition of the user-facing
view.

## Limits

- The maximum `Content-Length` accepted at the edge is 1 MB; larger payloads
  will be dropped and [the request will return a 413 response code](https://mozilla.github.io/gcp-ingestion/architecture/edge_service_specification/#server-requestresponse)
- The maximum payload size after being decompressed in the Decoder is 8 MB;
  larger payloads will trigger a `PayloadTooLarge` exception and be sent to
  error output
- Hard limit of 10,000 columns per table in BigQuery (see [Load job limits](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas#load_jobs))
- Max of 1,000,000 streaming inserts per second per BigQuery table, lower if we populate `insertId` (see [Streaming insert limits](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas#streaming_inserts))
- A PubSub topic without any subscriptions drops all messages until a subscription is created
- API Rate Limit: 20 req/sec
