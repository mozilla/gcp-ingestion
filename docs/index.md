# GCP Ingestion

[GCP Ingestion](https://github.com/mozilla/gcp-ingestion/) is a monorepo for
documentation and implementation of the Mozilla telemetry ingestion system
deployed to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

The components are:

- [ingestion-edge](ingestion-edge): a simple Python service for accepting HTTP
  messages and delivering to Google Cloud Pub/Sub
  ([deployment docs ðŸ”’](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SRE/Ingestion+Edge))
- [ingestion-beam](ingestion-beam): a Java module defining
  [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) jobs for streaming and batch
  transformations of ingested messages
  ([deployment docs ðŸ”’](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SRE/Ingestion+Beam))
- [ingestion-sink](ingestion-sink): a Java application that runs
  in Kubernetes, reading input from Google Cloud Pub/Sub and emitting
  records to outputs like GCS or BigQuery
  ([deployment docs ðŸ”’](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SRE/Ingestion+Sink))

The design behind the system along with various trade offs are documented in
the [architecture section](./architecture/overview.md).

This project requires Java 11.
To manage multiple local JDKs, consider [jenv](https://www.jenv.be/) and the
`jenv enable-plugin maven` command.
Also consider reading through
[Apache Beam's wiki article on IntelliJ IDEA setup](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/BEAM/Set+up+IntelliJ+from+scratch)
for some ideas on configuring an IDE environment.

Feel free to ask us in `#data-help` on Slack or `#telemetry` on `chat.mozilla.org`
if you have specific questions.
